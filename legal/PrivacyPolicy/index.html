Accordingly, we have implemented this Privacy Notice which describes how we collect and use your personal information, what we do with the information collected, and how you can exercise your privacy rights.</p><h2>Who we are</h2><p>ChronosDB, Inc. (ChronosDB) is a US headquartered time series storage and analytics provider that offers following products:</p><ul><li>ChronosDB, a time series database.</li><li>tshub, a cloud-based time series collaboration, storage, and managment solution.</li></ul><p>Under EU data protection legislation, commonly known as the GDPR, ChronosDB is the controller of processing of personal information described below. With regard to the processing of data uploaded to our platform by our users when using our services, however, ChronosDB is the processor and the person or organization owning the ChronosDB account is the controller. We explain more about the distinction between a controller and a processor under EU data protection legislation.</p><h2>What personal information do we collect?</h2><h3>Information you provide to us</h3><p>When requesting to use ChronosDB&#x27;s services we may ask you to provide personal information to us. For example, when you create a tshub account, we will ask you for your email address and a password. We may also ask for your phone number for purposes such as two-factor verification or for sending you service alerts. If you choose to sign up for one of ChronosDB&#x27;s services, we will ask you for billing information. To order a physical item from us, such as a Restore by Mail, we will ask for shipping details. At times we may ask for other information such as your name or the name of your company name.</p><p>During your interaction with ChronosDB, you may choose to provide us with personal information when you email us, chat with us, answer a survey, comment on our blog, or communicate with us through social media services like Twitter or Facebook.</p><p>If you refer a friend to ChronosDB, we will ask you for their email address. ChronosDB will then contact your referred friend to determine whether your friend consents to us contacting them.</p><p>When you use any ChronosDB product we may collect certain information automatically from and about your device. This includes data about your software, the operating system you use when accessing our service, your Internet Protocol address and the date and time of each request you make to ChronosDB.</p><p>Collecting this information enables us to better diagnose problems with our products, provide customer support more effectively, inform you about operating systems we no longer support as well as ensure the continuous functionality of our products.</p><h3>Information that we collect from third parties</h3><p>We may collect additional information about you from third parties primarily to assist us in understanding how we can maintain and improve the services we offer to better serve you. Third party tools that we use for this are from: Google Analytics which informs ChronosDB about page visits which in turn allows ChronosDB to decide if it needs to update certain pages. SurveyMonkey, which ChronosDB uses to distribute surveys, which users can voluntarily complete, will collect a user&#x27;s IP address.</p><h2>What we do with your personal information</h2><p>Under no circumstances do we rent, trade or share your address or e-mail address with any other company for their marketing purposes without your consent. We may use the information we collect through our products for a number of reasons, including to:</p><ul><li>provide, operate, optimize and maintain our online platforms, products and services;</li><li>understand how you use our products and customize your experience;</li><li>set up online accounts;</li><li>process, fulfill and provide any updates on online orders;</li><li>send you marketing communications we think you&#x27;ll find valuable, where it is in accordance with your preferences;</li><li>provide customer support via online chat services; deal with your online enquiries and requests sent by email; and provide you with information and access to resources or services that you have requested from us;</li><li>improve the layout, navigation and content of our online products;</li><li>identify any server problems or other IT or network issues;</li><li>prevent abuse of the products and services we offer; and</li><li>carry out other legitimate business purposes, such as to improve our products and services, as well as other lawful purposes about which we will notify our users and clients.</li></ul><h3>Email Communications</h3><p>From time to time, ChronosDB will communicate with you via email. There are two types of email you may receive:</p><ol><li><b>Service Emails:</b> These are service related emails such as confirmation of password change, expiration of credit card, or a reply to a support issue. You cannot opt out of receiving these messages as they are part of the service which ChronosDB provides to you. You can manage certain Service Emails by signing in to your Account. To stop receiving all Service Emails, you must cancel the service and uninstall the ChronosDB software from your devices.</li><br><li><b>Marketing Emails:</b> These will include ChronosDB company news, tips-and-tricks, service promotions (e.g., refer-a-friend) and similar types of material. Upon creating a ChronosDB Account you will be able to manage your email preferences, including opting out of receiving all Marketing Emails. You will also be able to unsubscribe at any time by using the unsubscribe link provided in any given email.</li></ol><br>We will only process personal information in ways that are compatible with the purpose we collected it for or for the purposes you later authorise. Before we use your personal information for a purpose that is materially different than the purpose we collected it for or that you later authorised, we will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out.<br><br><br><a name="section-5"></a><h2>Who we share your information with</h2><p>We may share and disclose your personally identifiable information only in the limited circumstances described below:</p><ul><li>To vendors and other third party service providers who require access to your personal information to assist in providing and improving our products. The third parties that access and use your information only on our behalf include companies such as Stripe, Salesforce, Google Analytics, Freshbooks, Facebook, Twitter, Hubspot, MailChimp, Plivo, Slack, SurveyMonkey, SendGrid, Twillio, and ZenDesk.

Refer to your organization&#x27;s internal policies for more information.</li><li>tshub users can give third parties the ability to access information and content in their account (e.g., through APIs). When other services access and use your information, their conduct is governed by their own terms and policies.</li><li>The settings for tshub also give you the option to make information and content available to other people.</li><li>We may disclose aggregate, non-identifying information about how our users use ChronosDB products.</li></ul><br><br><h2>Legal basis for processing your personal information<br>(EEA visitors/customers only)</h2>If you are a visitor/customer located in the European Economic Area (&quot;EEA&quot;), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. We will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate business interests. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.<br><br>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to enter into a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate business interests, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate business interests are.<br><br>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the <a href="#contactus">&#x27;How to contact us&#x27;</a> heading below.<br><br><br><a name="section-7"></a><h2>Cookies and similar tracking technology</h2><p>Like all e-commerce websites we use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively &quot;Cookies&quot;) to collect and use personal information about you.</p><a name="section-9"></a><h2>How we protect your information</h2><p>The security of your personal information is very important to us.</p><p>When you enter personal information such as a credit card number on our website or via our App we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). For purchases made online with credit cards, we receive your credit card number in encrypted form, and transfer it to our credit card processor, Stripe, for processing. Our employees do not have access to this information. We do not store PIN data or 3-digit security codes.</p><p>We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p><a name="section-10"></a><h2>Your data protection rights &amp; choices</h2><p>You have the following rights:</p><ul><li>If you wish to <strong>access</strong> your personal information that ChronosDB collects, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under <a href="#contactus">&#x27;How to contact us&#x27;</a> heading below.</li><li>You can <strong>correct, update or request deletion</strong> of your details in your Account by logging in to your Account.

Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details below.</li><li>Similarly, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong>at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li><li>You have the <strong>right to complain to a data protection authority</strong> about our collection and use of your personal information. Contact details for data protection authorities in the EEA, Switzerland and certain non-European countries (including the U.S. and Canada) are available <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm">here</a>.)</li></ul><p>You have the right to <strong>opt-out of marketing communications</strong> we send you at any time.
