Our mission is to reinvent the way we work with time series starting with storage, management, and sharing your time series data, through exploration and visualization, and ending on time series econometric and machine learning analytics. These terms of service (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) cover your use and access to our services, client software and websites (&quot;<strong>Services</strong>&quot;).</p><h2>Your Stuff &amp; Your Permissions</h2><p>When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, messages, contacts, and so on (“<strong>Your Stuff</strong>”). Your Stuff is yours. These Terms don’t give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.</p><p>We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up, and sharing it when you ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like commenting, sharing, searching, image thumbnails, document previews, optical character recognition (OCR), easy sorting and organization, and personalization to help reduce busywork. To provide these and other features, ChronosDB accesses, stores, and scans Your Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with.</p><h2>Your Responsibilities</h2><p> Your use of our Services must comply with our <a href="/legal/AcceptableUsePolicy">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. Content in the Services may be protected by others’ intellectual property rights. Please don’t copy, upload, download, or share content unless you have the right to do so.</p><p>tshub may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our <a href="/legal/AcceptableUsePolicy">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. We aren’t responsible for the content people post and share via the Services.</p><p>Help us keep Your Stuff protected. Safeguard your password to the Services, and keep your account information current. Don’t share your account credentials or give others access to your account.</p><p>You may use our Services only as permitted by applicable law, including export control laws and regulations. Finally, to use our Services, you must be at least 13 (or older, depending on where you live).</p><h2>Software</h2><p>Some of our Services allow you to download client software (“<strong>Software</strong>”) which may update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, we’ll make that license available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.</p><h2>Our Stuff</h2><p>The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and foreign laws. These Terms don’t grant you any right, title, or interest in the Services, others’ content in the Services, ChronosDB trademarks, logos and other brand features. We welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments or suggestions without any obligation to you.</p><h2>Services “AS IS”</h2><p>We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can&#x27;t guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CHRONOSDB AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS IS.&quot; WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some places don’t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.</p><h2>Limitation of Liability</h2><p>WE DON’T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO—THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR CHRONOSDB’S OR ITS AFFILIATES’ FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES. IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN’T ALLOWED, WE&#x27;RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU. THIS PARAGRAPH DOESN’T AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CAN&#x27;T BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT.</p><p>IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, CHRONOSDB, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WON’T BE LIABLE FOR:</p><p class="indented">i. ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR</p><p class="indented">ii. ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.</p><p>THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT CHRONOSDB OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p><p>IF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS, OR RE-SALE PURPOSE, CHRONOSDB, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. TSHUB AND ITS AFFILIATES AREN’T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES.</p><p>OTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION), WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE GREATER OF $20 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU&#x27;VE PAID UNDER YOUR CURRENT SERVICE PLAN WITH CHRONOSDB.</p><h2>Controlling Law</h2><p>These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer&#x27;s country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws.</p><h2>Entire Agreement</h2><p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and ChronosDB with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p><h2>Waiver, Severability &amp; Assignment</h2><p>ChronosDB’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. ChronosDB may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p><h2>Modifications</h2><p>We may revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect:</p><p class="indented">(a) changes to the law,</p><p class="indented">(b) new regulatory requirements, or</p><p class="indented">(c) improvements or enhancements made to our Services.</p><p>If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services, we’ll notify you prior to the update&#x27;s effective date by sending an email to the email address associated with your account or via an in-product notification. These updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you.</p><p>If you don’t agree to the updates we make, please cancel your account before they become effective. Where applicable, we’ll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for Services and your account cancellation date. By continuing to use or access the Services after the updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Blog</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog/">Blog</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Legal</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a aria-current="page" class="footer__link-item active" href="/legal/TermsofService">Terms of Service</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/legal/PrivacyPolicy">Privacy Policy</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/legal/AcceptableUsePolicy">Acceptable Use Policy</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title"></h4></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title"></h4></div></div><div class="text--center">Copyright © 2020 ChronosDB, Inc.</div></div></footer>
